# Sharding

Sharding is a way to split your bot into multiple processes, allowing you to have more control over your bot's performance and scalability.
You do not need to worry about sharding until your bot hits around 2,400 guilds. You must shard by the time you hit 2,500 guilds, however.

Unfortunately dixt is not designed to be on more than 2500 guilds and is not designed to be sharded. If you want to shard your bot, you will have to do it yourself.

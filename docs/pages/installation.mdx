# Installation

System Requirements:

- [Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Manual Installation

To manually create a new dixt bot, install the required package:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    dixt is available as a [npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/dixt).

    ```bash
    npm i dixt --save
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    dixt is available as a [yarn package](https://yarnpkg.com/package/dixt).

    ```bash
    yarn add dixt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    dixt is available as a [npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/dixt).

    ```bash
    pnpm i dixt
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Open `package.json` and add the following `scripts`:
  
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "dixt dev",
    "build": "dixt build",
    "start": "dixt start"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs `dixt dev` to start dixt in development mode.
- `build`: runs `dixt build` to build the application for production usage.
- `start`: runs `dixt start` to start a dixt production bot.

### Create the `index.js` file

Next, create a `index.js` file with some initial content:

```js
const { default: dixt } = require('dixt');

const main = async () => {
  const instance = new dixt();
  await instance.start();
};

main();
```

### Setting up your environment

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```env
DIXT_APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id
DIXT_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
```

If you don't know where to find thoses informations:
- `DIXT_APPLICATION_ID`: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) -> Select the application -> General Information -> Application ID
- `DIXT_BOT_TOKEN`: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) -> Select the application -> Bot -> Token

##### Alternative to environment variables

If you don't want to use environment variables, you can use the following code:


```js
const { default: dixt } = require('dixt');
 
const main = async () => {
  const options = {
    application: {
      id: 'your_application_id',
      bot: {
        token: 'your_bot_token',
      }
    }
  };
  const instance = new dixt(options);
  await instance.start();
};
 
main();
```

<Callout type="warning">
  This method is not recommended, because it can cause some security issues, especially if you are using a public repository.
</Callout>


#### Discord Bot Configuration

To ensure that the bot is working properly, you need be sure the following options are like this on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) -> Select the application -> Bot:

##### Authorization Flow
- **Public Bot**: We recommend to disable this option, because it can cause some security issues if your bot isn't ready to be public.
- **Require OAuth2 Code Grant**: We recommend to disable this option, if you don't know what you are doing.

##### Privileged Gateway Intents
- **Presence Intent**: We recommend to enable this option, because it's required to get the presence of users.
- **Server Members Intent**: Enable this option, because it's required to get the list of members of guilds.
- **Message Content Intent**: We recommend to enable this option, because it's required to get the content of messages.

##### Bot Permissions

To ensure that the bot has all the required permissions, invite your bot to your server using the following link: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your_application_id&scope=bot&permissions=8`.

<Callout>
  Do not forget to replace `your_application_id` by your application id.
</Callout>

Otherwise if you want to customize the permissions (which is not recommended), you can use a [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html).

### Run the Development Bot


<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Run `yarn run dev` to start the development server.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

# Discord.js Essentials

To build bot with dixt, it helps to be familiar with discord.js features such as client or shards. This page will give you a brief overview of these features.

If you"re new to discord.js, we also recommend reffering to the [discord.js Documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome). Here are some great resources for learning:
- [discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide)
- [discord.js Rapid Tutorial](https://ravbug.com/tutorials/discordjs)
- [discord.js freeCodeCamp Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-javascript-nodejs)

## Client

The client is the main interface for interacting with the Discord API, and the starting point for any bot. It is the main class in discord.js.

<Tabs items={["without dixt", "with dixt"]}>
<Tab>
```js
const { Client } = require("discord.js");

const client = new Client();

client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.login("your_bot_token");
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```js
const { default: dixt } = require("dixt");

const instance = new dixt({
  application: {
    id: "your_application_id",
    bot: {
      token: "your_bot_token",
    }
  }
});

instance.client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${instance.client.user.tag}!`);
});

instance.start();
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
